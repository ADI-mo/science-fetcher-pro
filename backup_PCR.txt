ABSTRACT:
Polymerase chain reaction is an important tool in molecular biology. Although the principles of the technique are relatively simple, amplifying complex or long DNA segments can be challenging. A variety of PCR additives are used to improve the performance and yield of difficult PCRs. Each PCR additive has unique properties and enhances PCR through a different mode of action. They are used to either improve PCR sensitivity, efficiency, and specificity, or mitigate the effects of PCR inhibitors. In this review, we categorise known PCR additives into four main groups. The first three groups comprise PCR additives with well-defined mechanisms, namely those that facilitate the amplification of GC-rich sequences, counteract the detrimental effects of PCR inhibitors, or alter PCR kinetics (nanomaterials). The fourth group is a loose mix of additives with unclear mechanisms of action. Then, we discuss how these additives may be used to tackle specific PCR-related challenges, particularly those associated with long-range PCR. We conclude the review with added insights into the use of PCR additives in enhancing the synthesis of complex and long DNA fragments.

AUTHORS:  Bachman J

ABSTRACT:
RT-PCR is commonly used to test for genetic diseases and to characterize gene expression in various tissue types, cell types, and over developmental time courses. This serves as a form of expression profiling, but typically as a candidate approach. RT-PCR is also commonly used to clone cDNAs for further use with other molecular biology techniques (e.g., see Oligo(dT)-primed RT-PCR isolation of polyadenylated RNA degradation intermediates and Circularized RT-PCR (cRT-PCR): analysis of RNA 5' ends, 3' ends, and poly(A) tails).

JOURNAL:  Genome research (1996)
AUTHORS:  Heid CA, Stevens J, Livak KJ, Williams PM

ABSTRACT:
We have developed a novel "real time" quantitative PCR method. The method measures PCR product accumulation through a dual-labeled fluorogenic probe (i.e., TaqMan Probe). This method provides very accurate and reproducible quantitation of gene copies. Unlike other quantitative PCR methods, real-time PCR does not require post-PCR sample handling, preventing potential PCR product carry-over contamination and resulting in much faster and higher throughput assays. The real-time PCR method has a very large dynamic range of starting target molecule determination (at least five orders of magnitude). Real-time quantitative PCR is extremely accurate and less labor-intensive than current quantitative PCR methods.

LINK:     https://openalex.org/W2108244474
JOURNAL:  Nucleic Acids Research (2001)
AUTHORS:  Michael W. Pfaffl

ABSTRACT:
Use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA products reverse transcribed from mRNA is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.

TITLE:    Amp-PCR: Combining a Random Unbiased Phi29-Amplification with a Specific Real-Time PCR, Performed in One Tube to Increase PCR Sensitivity
LINK:     https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015719
JOURNAL:  PLoS ONE (2010)
AUTHORS:  

ABSTRACT:

        In clinical situations where a diagnostic real-time PCR assay is not sensitive enough, leading to low or falsely negative results, or where detection earlier in a disease progression would benefit the patient, an unbiased pre-amplification prior to the real-time PCR could be beneficial. In Amp-PCR, an unbiased random Phi29 pre-amplification is combined with a specific real-time PCR reaction. The two reactions are separated physically by a wax-layer (AmpliWax®) and are run in sequel in the same sealed tube. Amp-PCR can increase the specific PCR signal at least 100×106-fold and make it possible to detect positive samples normally under the detection limit of the specific real-time PCR. The risk of contamination is eliminated and Amp-PCR could replace nested-PCR in situations where increased sensitivity is needed e.g. in routine PCR diagnostic analysis. We show Amp-PCR to work on clinical samples containing circular and linear viral dsDNA genomes, but can work well on DNA of any origin, both from non-cellular (virus) and cellular sources (bacteria, archae, eukaryotes).

TITLE:    Subduing the influence of PCR inhibitors on amplifying aged, degraded, and low copy number DNA: PCR enhancer cocktail-p and rescue PCR

ABSTRACT:

PCR inhibitors are a formidable problem to the study of aged, degraded, and/or low copy number DNA. As a result, there is a need to find alternate methods that ameliorate the efficacy of PCR. In this study, we attempted to use genetic methods to identify the species of salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) remains recovered from archaeological sites along the Feather River located in northern California, United States. In the process of doing so, we compared the efficacy of a PCR enhancer cocktail called “PEC-P” and a reagent rich PCR recipe called “rescue PCR” over standard PCR. Across all treatments (full concentration and 1:10 dilute eluates subjected to standard PCR, PEC-P, and rescue PCR) species identification was possible for 74 of 93 archaeological fish specimens (79.6%). Overall, six of the 93 samples (6.5%) consistently yielded species identification across all treatments. The species of ten specimens (10.8%) were uniquely identified from amplicons produced with either PEC-P or rescue PCR or both. Notably, the species of seven samples (7.5%) were uniquely identified with standard PCR over the alternative treatments. Considering both full concentration and 1:10 dilute eluates (N = 186), standard PCR performed as well as PEC-P (p = 0.1451) and rescue (p = 0.6753). Yet, considering results from full concentration eluates alone (N = 93), PEC-P (60.2%) outperformed both standard PCR (44.1%; p = 0.0277) and rescue PCR (40.9%; p = 0.0046). Stochasticity observed in our study cautions us against choosing a “best” performing method of those explored here and suggests their respective potentials to improve success may be sample dependent. When working with samples compromised by PCR inhibitors, it is useful to have alternative methodologies for subduing the problem. Both PEC-P and rescue PCR represent useful alternative methods for the study of aged, degraded, and/or low copy number DNA samples compromised by PCR inhibitors.

LINK:     https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012629
JOURNAL:  PLoS ONE (2010)
AUTHORS:  

ABSTRACT:
Background: ExCyto PCR cells provide a novel and cost effective means to amplify DNA transformed into competent bacterial cells. ExCyto PCR uses host E. coli with a chromosomally integrated gene encoding a thermostable DNA polymerase to accomplish robust, hot-start PCR amplification of cloned sequences without addition of exogenous enzyme. Results: Because the thermostable DNA polymerase is stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome, ExCyto cells can be transformed with a single plasmid or complex library, and then the expressed thermostable DNA polymerase can be used for PCR amplification. We demonstrate that ExCyto cells can be used to amplify DNA from different templates, plasmids with different copy numbers, and master mixes left on ice for up to two hours. Further, PCR amplification with ExCyto cells is comparable to amplification using commercial DNA polymerases. The ability to transform a bacterial strain and use the endogenously expressed protein for PCR has not previously been demonstrated. Conclusions: ExCyto PCR reduces pipetting and greatly increases throughput for screening EST, genomic, BAC, cDNA, or SNP libraries. This technique is also more economical than traditional PCR and thus broadly useful to scientists who utilize analysis of cloned DNAs in their research.

TITLE:    PCR-CG: Point Cloud Registration via Deep Explicit Color and Geometry
LINK:     http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14418v2
JOURNAL:  arXiv (2023)
AUTHORS:  ...

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, we introduce PCR-CG: a novel 3D point cloud registration module explicitly embedding the color signals into the geometry representation. Different from previous methods that only use geometry representation, our module is specifically designed to effectively correlate color into geometry for the point cloud registration task. Our key contribution is a 2D-3D cross-modality learning algorithm that embeds the deep features learned from color signals to the geometry representation. With our designed 2D-3D projection module, the pixel features in a square region centered at correspondences perceived from images are effectively correlated with point clouds. In this way, the overlapped regions can be inferred not only from point cloud but also from the texture appearances. Adding color is non-trivial. We compare against a variety of baselines designed for adding color to 3D, such as exhaustively adding per-pixel features or RGB values in an implicit manner. We leverage Predator [25] as the baseline method and incorporate our proposed module onto it. To validate the effectiveness of 2D features, we ablate different 2D pre-trained networks and show a positive correlation between the pre-trained weights and the task performance. Our experimental results indicate a significant improvement of 6.5% registration recall over the baseline method on the 3DLoMatch benchmark. We additionally evaluate our approach on SOTA methods and observe consistent improvements, such as an improvement of 2.4% registration recall over GeoTransformer as well as 3.5% over CoFiNet. Our study reveals a significant advantages of correlating explicit deep color features to the point cloud in the registration task.

TITLE:    VD-PCR: Improving Visual Dialog with Pronoun Coreference Resolution
LINK:     http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14693v1
JOURNAL:  arXiv (2022)
AUTHORS:  ...

ABSTRACT:
The visual dialog task requires an AI agent to interact with humans in multi-round dialogs based on a visual environment. As a common linguistic phenomenon, pronouns are often used in dialogs to improve the communication efficiency. As a result, resolving pronouns (i.e., grounding pronouns to the noun phrases they refer to) is an essential step towards understanding dialogs. In this paper, we propose VD-PCR, a novel framework to improve Visual Dialog understanding with Pronoun Coreference Resolution in both implicit and explicit ways. First, to implicitly help models understand pronouns, we design novel methods to perform the joint training of the pronoun coreference resolution and visual dialog tasks. Second, after observing that the coreference relationship of pronouns and their referents indicates the relevance between dialog rounds, we propose to explicitly prune the irrelevant history rounds in visual dialog models' input. With pruned input, the models can focus on relevant dialog history and ignore the distraction in the irrelevant one. With the proposed implicit and explicit methods, VD-PCR achieves state-of-the-art experimental results on the VisDial dataset.

TITLE:    AmpliconHunter: A Scalable Tool for PCR Amplicon Prediction from Microbiome Samples
LINK:     http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13300v1
JOURNAL:  arXiv (2025)
AUTHORS:  ...

ABSTRACT:
Sequencing of PCR amplicons generated using degenerate primers (typically targeting a region of the 16S ribosomal gene) is widely used in metagenomics to profile the taxonomic composition of complex microbial samples. To reduce taxonomic biases in primer selection it is important to conduct in silico PCR analyses of the primers against large collections of up to millions of bacterial genomes. However, existing in silico PCR tools have impractical running time for analyses of this scale. In this paper we introduce AmpliconHunter, a highly scalable in silico PCR package distributed as open-source command-line tool and publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at https://ah1.engr.uconn.edu/. AmpliconHunter implements an accurate nearest-neighbor model for melting temperature calculations, allowing for primer-template hybridization with mismatches, along with three complementary methods for estimating off-target amplification. By taking advantage of multi-core parallelism and SIMD operations available on modern CPUs, the AmpliconHunter web server can complete in silico PCR analyses of commonly used degenerate primer pairs against the 2.4M genomes in the latest AllTheBacteria collection in as few as 6-7 hours.
