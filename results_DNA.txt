Title:    Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage
URL:      https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6832e380440cd44551ca451bd16eb830a44be5cf
Journal:  Nature (2016)

Abstract:
Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of ‘base editing’, a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting ‘base editors’ convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15–75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.

Journal:  Genome Biology (2009)
Authors:  Ben Langmead, C. Trapnell, Mihai Pop
Abstract:
Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient alignment program for aligning short DNA sequence reads to large genomes. For the human genome, Burrows-Wheeler indexing allows Bowtie to align more than 25 million reads per CPU hour with a memory footprint of approximately 1.3 gigabytes. Bowtie extends previous Burrows-Wheeler techniques with a novel quality-aware backtracking algorithm that permits mismatches. Multiple processor cores can be used simultaneously to achieve even greater alignment speeds. Bowtie is open source http://bowtie.cbcb.umd.edu.

Title:    DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors
URL:      https://openalex.org/W2138270253
Journal:  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (1977)
Authors:  Frederick Sanger, S. Nicklen, Alan Coulson
Abstract:
A new method for determining nucleotide sequences in DNA is described. It is similar to the “plus and minus” method [Sanger, F. &amp; Coulson, A. R. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 94, 441-448] but makes use of the 2′,3′-dideoxy and arabinonucleoside analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which act as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerase. The technique has been applied to the DNA of bacteriophage ϕX174 and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method.

Title:    Primer-Directed Enzymatic Amplification of DNA with a Thermostable DNA Polymerase
URL:      https://openalex.org/W2032118018
Journal:  Science (1988)
Authors:  Randall K. Saiki, David H. Gelfand, Susanne Stoffel
Abstract:
A thermostable DNA polymerase was used in an in vitro DNA amplification procedure, the polymerase chain reaction. The enzyme, isolated from Thermus aquaticus , greatly simplifies the procedure and, by enabling the amplification reaction to be performed at higher temperatures, significantly improves the specificity, yield, sensitivity, and length of products that can be amplified. Single-copy genomic sequences were amplified by a factor of more than 10 million with very high specificity, and DNA segments up to 2000 base pairs were readily amplified. In addition, the method was used to amplify and detect a target DNA molecule present only once in a sample of 10 5 cells.

Title:    Stability of mRNA/DNA and DNA/DNA Duplexes Affects mRNA Transcription
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000290
Journal:  PLoS ONE (2007)
Authors:  
Abstract:
Nucleic acids, due to their structural and chemical properties, can form double-stranded secondary structures that assist the transfer of genetic information and can modulate gene expression. However, the nucleotide sequence alone is insufficient in explaining phenomena like intron-exon recognition during RNA processing. This raises the question whether nucleic acids are endowed with other attributes that can contribute to their biological functions. In this work, we present a calculation of thermodynamic stability of DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes across the genomes of four species in the genus Saccharomyces by nearest-neighbor method. The results show that coding regions are more thermodynamically stable than introns, 3′-untranslated regions and intergenic sequences. Furthermore, open reading frames have more stable sense mRNA/DNA duplexes than the potential antisense duplexes, a property that can aid gene discovery. The lower stability of the DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes of 3′-untranslated regions and the higher stability of genes correlates with increased mRNA level. These results suggest that the thermodynamic stability of DNA/DNA and mRNA/DNA duplexes affects mRNA transcription.

Title:    PARP1 recruits DNA translocases to restrain DNA replication and facilitate DNA repair
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010545
Journal:  PLOS Genetics (2022)
Authors:  
Abstract:

Replication fork reversal which restrains DNA replication progression is an important protective mechanism in response to replication stress. PARP1 is recruited to stalled forks to restrain DNA replication. However, PARP1 has no helicase activity, and the mechanism through which PARP1 participates in DNA replication restraint remains unclear. Here, we found novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. Although HLTF and SHPRH share structural and functional similarity, it remains unclear whether SHPRH contains DNA translocase activity. We further identified the ability of SHPRH to restrain DNA replication upon replication stress, indicating that SHPRH itself could be a DNA translocase or a helper to facilitate DNA translocation. Although hydroxyurea (HU) and MMS induce different types of replication stress, they both induce common DNA replication restraint mechanisms independent of intra-S phase activation. Our results suggest that the PARP1 facilitates DNA translocase recruitment to damaged forks, preventing fork collapse and facilitating DNA repair.
Author summary: Replication stress induces genomic instability and is associated with cancer development. PARP1 is not only involved in base-excision repair (BER), but also restrains replication fork progression upon replication stress. However, PARP1 has no helicase activities, and the mechanism through which PARP1 participates in the formation of reversed replication forks remains unclear. In the present study, we identified novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. This finding is particularly important because PARP1 inhibitors are effective against homologous recombination deficient cancers. Our study reveals an additional function of PARP1, which restrains replication progression through interaction with DNA translocases and provides an important protective mechanism in response to replication stress.

Title:    DNA Topology and the Initiation of Virus DNA Packaging
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154785
Journal:  PLOS ONE (2016)
Authors:  
Abstract:

During progeny assembly, viruses selectively package virion genomes from a nucleic acid pool that includes host nucleic acids. For large dsDNA viruses, including tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses, immature viral DNA is recognized and translocated into a preformed icosahedral shell, the prohead. Recognition involves specific interactions between the viral packaging enzyme, terminase, and viral DNA recognition sites. Generally, viral DNA is recognized by terminase’s small subunit (TerS). The large terminase subunit (TerL) contains translocation ATPase and endonuclease domains. In phage lambda, TerS binds a sequence repeated three times in cosB, the recognition site. TerS binding to cosB positions TerL to cut the concatemeric DNA at the adjacent nicking site, cosN. TerL introduces staggered nicks in cosN, generating twelve bp cohesive ends. Terminase separates the cohesive ends and remains bound to the cosB-containing end, in a nucleoprotein structure called Complex I. Complex I docks on the prohead’s portal vertex and translocation ensues. DNA topology plays a role in the TerSλ-cosBλ interaction. Here we show that a site, I2, located between cosN and cosB, is critically important for an early DNA packaging step. I2 contains a complex static bend. I2 mutations block DNA packaging. I2 mutant DNA is cut by terminase at cosN in vitro, but in vivo, no cos cleavage is detected, nor is there evidence for Complex I. Models for what packaging step might be blocked by I2 mutations are presented.

Title:    DNA structure and function.
URL:      https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Journal:  The FEBS journal (2015)
Authors:  Travers A, Muskhelishvili G
Abstract:
The proposal of a double-helical structure for DNA over 60 years ago provided an eminently satisfying explanation for the heritability of genetic information. But why is DNA, and not RNA, now the dominant biological information store? We argue that, in addition to its coding function, the ability of DNA, unlike RNA, to adopt a B-DNA structure confers advantages both for information accessibility and for packaging. The information encoded by DNA is both digital - the precise base specifying, for example, amino acid sequences - and analogue. The latter determines the sequence-dependent physicochemical properties of DNA, for example, its stiffness and susceptibility to strand separation. Most importantly, DNA chirality enables the formation of supercoiling under torsional stress. We review recent evidence suggesting that DNA supercoiling, particularly that generated by DNA translocases, is a major driver of gene regulation and patterns of chromosomal gene organization, and in its guise as a promoter of DNA packaging enables DNA to act as an energy store to facilitate the passage of translocating enzymes such as RNA polymerase.

Authors:  Lindahl TR
Abstract:
In this autobiographical article, I reflect on my Swedish background. Then I discuss endogenous DNA alterations and the base excision repair pathway and alternative repair strategies for some unusual DNA lesions. Endogenous DNA damage, such as loss of purine bases and cytosine deamination, is proposed as a major source of cancer-causing mutations.

Title:    Effect of Internal Viscosity on Brownian Dynamics of DNA Molecules in Shear Flow
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0703003v1
Journal:  arXiv (2007)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
The results of Brownian dynamics simulations of a single DNA molecule in shear flow are presented taking into account the effect of internal viscosity. The dissipative mechanism of internal viscosity is proved necessary in the research of DNA dynamics. A stochastic model is derived on the basis of the balance equation for forces acting on the chain. The Euler method is applied to the solution of the model. The extensions of DNA molecules for different Weissenberg numbers are analyzed. Comparison with the experimental results available in the literature is carried out to estimate the contribution of the effect of internal viscosity.

Title:    The Art of DNA Strings: Sixteen Years of DNA Coding Theory
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00266v1
Journal:  arXiv (2016)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
The idea of computing with DNA was given by Tom Head in 1987, however in 1994 in a seminal paper, the actual successful experiment for DNA computing was performed by Adleman. The heart of the DNA computing is the DNA hybridization, however, it is also the source of errors. Thus the success of the DNA computing depends on the error control techniques. The classical coding theory techniques have provided foundation for the current information and communication technology (ICT). Thus it is natural to expect that coding theory will be the foundational subject for the DNA computing paradigm. For the successful experiments with DNA computing usually we design DNA strings which are sufficiently dissimilar. This leads to the construction of a large set of DNA strings which satisfy certain combinatorial and thermodynamic constraints. Over the last 16 years, many approaches such as combinatorial, algebraic, computational have been used to construct such DNA strings. In this work, we survey this interesting area of DNA coding theory by providing key ideas of the area and current known results.

Title:    DNA Nanotechnology Meets Nanophotonics
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03431v1
Journal:  arXiv (2021)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
In the past decades, DNA has been intensely studied and exploited in different research areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. At first glance, DNA-based nanophotonics seems to deviate quite far from the original goal of Nadrian Seeman, the founder of DNA nanotechnology, who hoped to organize biological entities using DNA in high-resolution crystals. As a matter of fact, DNA-based nanophotonics does closely follow his central spirit. That is, apart from being a genetic material for inheritance, DNA is also an ideal material for building molecular devices.
