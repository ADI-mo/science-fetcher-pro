ABSTRACT:
Abstract Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.

ABSTRACT:
Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of ‘base editing’, a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting ‘base editors’ convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15–75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.

ABSTRACT:
Most genetic variants that contribute to disease1 are challenging to correct efficiently and without excess byproducts2–5. Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay–Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.A new DNA-editing technique called prime editing offers improved versatility and efficiency with reduced byproducts compared with existing techniques, and shows potential for correcting disease-associated mutations.

ABSTRACT:
The proposal of a double-helical structure for DNA over 60 years ago provided an eminently satisfying explanation for the heritability of genetic information. But why is DNA, and not RNA, now the dominant biological information store? We argue that, in addition to its coding function, the ability of DNA, unlike RNA, to adopt a B-DNA structure confers advantages both for information accessibility and for packaging. The information encoded by DNA is both digital - the precise base specifying, for example, amino acid sequences - and analogue. The latter determines the sequence-dependent physicochemical properties of DNA, for example, its stiffness and susceptibility to strand separation. Most importantly, DNA chirality enables the formation of supercoiling under torsional stress. We review recent evidence suggesting that DNA supercoiling, particularly that generated by DNA translocases, is a major driver of gene regulation and patterns of chromosomal gene organization, and in its guise as a promoter of DNA packaging enables DNA to act as an energy store to facilitate the passage of translocating enzymes such as RNA polymerase.

JOURNAL:  Annual review of biochemistry (2017)
AUTHORS:  Burgers PMJ, Kunkel TA

ABSTRACT:
This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases α and δ carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively. This review also discusses alternative proposals, including cellular processes during which alternative forks may be utilized, and new biochemical studies with purified proteins that are aimed at reconstituting leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis separately and as an integrated replication fork.

ABSTRACT:
The standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a segment of DNA that lies between two inward-pointing primers. In contrast, inverse PCR (also known as inverted or inside-out PCR) is used to amplify DNA sequences that flank one end of a known DNA sequence and for which no primers are available. Inverse PCR DNA involves digestion by a restriction enzyme of a preparation of DNA containing the known sequence and its flanking region. The individual restriction fragments (many thousands in the case of total mammalian genomic DNA) are converted into circles by intramolecular ligation, and the circularized DNA is then used as a template in PCR. The unknown sequence is amplified by two primers that bind specifically to the known sequence and point in opposite directions. The product of the amplification reaction is a linear DNA fragment containing a single site for the restriction enzyme originally used to digest the DNA. This site marks the junction between the previously cloned sequence and the flanking sequences. The size of the amplified fragment depends on the distribution of restriction sites within known and flanking DNA sequences.

ABSTRACT:

Replication fork reversal which restrains DNA replication progression is an important protective mechanism in response to replication stress. PARP1 is recruited to stalled forks to restrain DNA replication. However, PARP1 has no helicase activity, and the mechanism through which PARP1 participates in DNA replication restraint remains unclear. Here, we found novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. Although HLTF and SHPRH share structural and functional similarity, it remains unclear whether SHPRH contains DNA translocase activity. We further identified the ability of SHPRH to restrain DNA replication upon replication stress, indicating that SHPRH itself could be a DNA translocase or a helper to facilitate DNA translocation. Although hydroxyurea (HU) and MMS induce different types of replication stress, they both induce common DNA replication restraint mechanisms independent of intra-S phase activation. Our results suggest that the PARP1 facilitates DNA translocase recruitment to damaged forks, preventing fork collapse and facilitating DNA repair.
Author summary: Replication stress induces genomic instability and is associated with cancer development. PARP1 is not only involved in base-excision repair (BER), but also restrains replication fork progression upon replication stress. However, PARP1 has no helicase activities, and the mechanism through which PARP1 participates in the formation of reversed replication forks remains unclear. In the present study, we identified novel protein-protein interactions between PARP1 and DNA translocases, including HLTF, SHPRH, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1, with HLTF showing the strongest interaction among these DNA translocases. This finding is particularly important because PARP1 inhibitors are effective against homologous recombination deficient cancers. Our study reveals an additional function of PARP1, which restrains replication progression through interaction with DNA translocases and provides an important protective mechanism in response to replication stress.

ABSTRACT:

During progeny assembly, viruses selectively package virion genomes from a nucleic acid pool that includes host nucleic acids. For large dsDNA viruses, including tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses, immature viral DNA is recognized and translocated into a preformed icosahedral shell, the prohead. Recognition involves specific interactions between the viral packaging enzyme, terminase, and viral DNA recognition sites. Generally, viral DNA is recognized by terminase’s small subunit (TerS). The large terminase subunit (TerL) contains translocation ATPase and endonuclease domains. In phage lambda, TerS binds a sequence repeated three times in cosB, the recognition site. TerS binding to cosB positions TerL to cut the concatemeric DNA at the adjacent nicking site, cosN. TerL introduces staggered nicks in cosN, generating twelve bp cohesive ends. Terminase separates the cohesive ends and remains bound to the cosB-containing end, in a nucleoprotein structure called Complex I. Complex I docks on the prohead’s portal vertex and translocation ensues. DNA topology plays a role in the TerSλ-cosBλ interaction. Here we show that a site, I2, located between cosN and cosB, is critically important for an early DNA packaging step. I2 contains a complex static bend. I2 mutations block DNA packaging. I2 mutant DNA is cut by terminase at cosN in vitro, but in vivo, no cos cleavage is detected, nor is there evidence for Complex I. Models for what packaging step might be blocked by I2 mutations are presented.

ABSTRACT:

Dpb11 is required for the initiation of DNA replication in budding yeast. We found that Dpb11 binds tightly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or branched DNA structures, while its human homolog, TopBP1, binds tightly to branched-DNA structures. We also found that Dpb11 binds stably to CDK-phosphorylated RPA, the eukaryotic ssDNA binding protein, in the presence of branched DNA. A Dpb11 mutant specifically defective for DNA binding did not exhibit tight binding to RPA in the presence of DNA, suggesting that Dpb11-interaction with DNA may promote the recruitment of RPA to melted DNA. We then characterized a mutant of Dpb11 that is specifically defective in DNA binding in budding yeast cells. Expression of dpb11-m1,2,3,5,ΔC results in a substantial decrease in RPA recruitment to origins, suggesting that Dpb11 interaction with DNA may be required for RPA recruitment to origins. Expression of dpb11-m1,2,3,5,ΔC also results in diminished GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 during S phase, while Cdc45 interaction with Mcm2-7 is like wild-type. The reduced GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 may be an indirect consequence of diminished origin melting. We propose that the tight interaction between Dpb11, CDK-phosphorylated RPA, and branched-DNA may be required for the essential function of stabilizing melted origin DNA in vivo. We also propose an alternative model, wherein Dpb11-DNA interaction is required for some other function in DNA replication initiation, such as helicase activation.

ABSTRACT:
Upon binding to cytosolic DNA, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is activated to catalyze the synthesis of cGAMP, which then activates downstream effectors and induces innate immune responses. The activation of cGAS relies on the formation of cGAS-DNA oligomers and liquid phase condensation, which are sensitive to the length and concentration of DNA. Although significant progresses have been made for the understanding of such a length- and concentration-dependent activation, some structural and energetic details of the cGAS-DNA oligomerization remains elusive. Here, with molecular dynamics simulations, we report the structure of the cGAS-DNA monomer (the cGAS<sub>1</sub>-DNA<sub>1</sub> complex), in which the DNA binds simultaneously to the major parts of two DNA-binding sites as observed in the cGAS-DNA dimer (the cGAS<sub>2</sub>-DNA<sub>2</sub> complex) and its active site is largely immature. Energetic analysis indicates that two cGAS<sub>1</sub>-DNA<sub>1</sub> complexes are just slightly less stable than the cGAS<sub>2</sub>-DNA<sub>2</sub> complex and there exists a significant energy barrier for the formation of the cGAS<sub>2</sub>-DNA<sub>2</sub> complex from two cGAS<sub>1</sub>-DNA<sub>1</sub> complexes, which provides thermodynamic and kinetic explanations for an experimental observation that cGAS-DNA oligomerization is unfavored in low concentration of cGAS and DNA.

ABSTRACT:
Nucleic acid nanotechnology (NAN) has emerged as a powerful platform for constructing programmable molecular architectures, with broad applications spanning biomedicine, materials science, and molecular computing. While numerous reviews have covered the design principles and functional modalities of enzyme-free NAN systems, a comprehensive framework for understanding enzyme-involved NAN remains conspicuously absent. Given the growing interest in enzyme-involved systems, enzymes offer distinct advantages to NAN, including enhanced programmability, dynamic control, and expanded functional versatility. This review addresses that gap by systematically categorizing the enzymatic toolkit-including polymerases, modifying enzymes, endo-/exonucleases, ligases, other protein-based enzymes, as well as nucleic acid enzymes such as DNAzymes, ribozymes, and XNAzymes-and elucidating their roles in enabling structural assembly and dynamic control at the molecular level. Enzymes function not only as assembly agents for nucleic acid nanostructures, facilitating strand extension, ligation, cleavage, and chemical modification, but also as essential driver tools mediating degradation, release, and template-guided polymerization. Their integration has led to highly adaptive and reconfigurable systems with capabilities far surpassing enzyme-free counterparts. We further highlight key advances in enzyme-powered NAN across diverse frontiers, including in vitro diagnostics (IVD), cellular and in vivo imaging, DNA data storage and computing, biomimetic material synthesis, and drug delivery. By mapping catalytic mechanisms to functional outputs, and identifying current bottlenecks in specificity, modularity, and integration, this review establishes a unified conceptual foundation and design roadmap for the next generation of enzyme-driven nucleic acid nanodevices.
