Abstract:
Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) is a condition characterized by the absence of menstruation, which is increasingly affecting young women. However, specific recommendations for treating and preventing this condition are lacking. Based on a review of the available literature, this article provides practical and feasible dietary management recommendations for healthcare professionals and researchers in women's health and nutrition. It answers the question of what interventions and nutritional recommendations are necessary to restore menstrual function in women struggling with FHA. Physicians recommend an energy availability threshold of 30 kcal/kg FFM/day to prevent FHA. Also, energy availability below and above this threshold can inhibit LH pulsation and cause menstrual disorders. In addition, the risk of menstrual disorders increases with a decrease in the caloric content of the diet and the duration of the energy deficit, and women with FHA have significantly lower energy availability than healthy women. It is essential to ensure that adequate kilocalories are provided throughout the day (regular meals that are a source of proper glucose) to avoid a negative energy balance, as glucose has been proven to affect LH pulses and T3 and cortisol concentrations in the body. Dietary intervention should focus on increasing the caloric content of the diet, thus increasing energy availability and restoring energy balance in the body. Treatment and diagnosis should also focus on body composition, not just body weight. An increase in body fat percentage above 22% may be required to restore menstrual function. In women with FHA, even an increase in body fat mass of one kilogram (kg) increases the likelihood of menstruation by 8%. It is advisable to reduce the intensity of physical activity or training volume, while it is not advisable to give up physical activity altogether. It is also important to ensure adequate intake of micronutrients, reduce stress, and incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Title:    Stress, kisspeptin, and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

Abstract:
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea in women of reproductive age. FHA is predominantly caused by stress, decreased caloric intake, excessive exercise, or a combination thereof. These physical, psychological, and metabolic stressors cause aberration in the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequently impair function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. Various neurotransmitters acting in the central nervous system are involved in control of the HPO axis and of these, kisspeptin is one of the most important. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), also inhibits the pulsatile secretion of GnRH and also acts as an intermediary between stress factors and the reproductive system. One of the main ongoing concerns in patients with FHA is chronic hypoestrogenism, a condition, which is associated with sexual dysfunction and infertility. It may also lead to osteoporosis, and predispose to neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Treatment of FHA requires the elimination of causative factors, however, making the necessary lifestyle changes is not always easy to initiate and maintain. Broadening our knowledge of the complex neural mechanisms regulating reproductive function in which kisspeptin plays a key role can help in the development of new treatment options such as the potential of kisspeptin receptor agonists for patients with FHA.

Title:    Where Have the Periods Gone? The Evaluation and Management of Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea.
URL:      https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32041389/
Journal:  Journal of clinical research in pediatric endocrinology (2020)
Authors:  Sophie Gibson ME, Fleming N, Zuijdwijk C, Dumont T
Abstract:
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is a common cause of amenorrhea in adolescent girls. It is often seen in the setting of stress, weight loss, or excessive exercise. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients with primary or secondary amenorrhea should be evaluated for other causes of amenorrhea before a diagnosis of FHA can be made. The evaluation typically consists of a thorough history and physical examination as well as endocrinological and radiological investigations. FHA, if prolonged, can have significant impacts on metabolic, bone, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health. Management often involves a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on lifestyle modification. Depending on the severity, pharmacologic therapy may also be considered. The aim of this paper is to present a review on the pathophysiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and management approaches of FHA in adolescent girls.

Title:    The FHA domain protein ArnA functions as a global DNA damage response repressor in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Saccharolobus islandicus

Abstract:
ABSTRACT Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain proteins specifically recognize phosphorylated threonine via the FHA domain and are involved in signal transduction in various processes especially DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation in eukaryotes. Although FHA domain proteins are found in prokaryotes, archaea, and bacteria, their functions are far less clear as compared to the eukaryotic counterparts, and it has not been studied whether archaeal FHA proteins play a role in DDR. Here, we have characterized an FHA protein from the hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeon Saccharolobus islandicus (SisArnA) by genetic, biochemical, and transcriptomic approaches. We find that ΔSisarnA exhibits higher resistance to DNA damage agent 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO). The transcription of ups genes, encoding the proteins for pili-mediated cell aggregation and cell survival after DDR, is elevated in ΔSisarnA. The interactions of SisArnA with two predicted partners, SisvWA1 (SisArnB) and SisvWA2 (designated as SisArnE), were enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro. ΔSisarnB displays higher resistance to NQO than the wild type. In addition, the interaction between SisArnA and SisArnB, which is reduced in the NQO-treated cells, is indispensable for DNA binding in vitro. These indicate that SisArnA and SisArnB work together to inhibit the expression of ups genes in vivo. Interestingly, ΔSisarnE is more sensitive to NQO than the wild type, and the interaction between SisArnA and SisArnE is strengthened after NQO treatment, suggesting a positive role of SisArnE in DDR. Finally, transcriptomic analysis reveals that SisArnA represses a number of genes, implying that archaea apply the FHA/phospho-peptide recognition module for extensive transcriptional regulation. IMPORTANCE Cellular adaption to diverse environmental stresses requires a signal sensor and transducer for cell survival. Protein phosphorylation and its recognition by forkhead-associated (FHA) domain proteins are widely used for signal transduction in eukaryotes. Although FHA proteins exist in archaea and bacteria, investigation of their functions, especially those in DNA damage response (DDR), is limited. Therefore, the evolution and functional conservation of FHA proteins in the three domains of life is still a mystery. Here, we find that an FHA protein from the hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeon Saccharolobus islandicus (SisArnA) represses the transcription of pili genes together with its phosphorylated partner SisArnB. SisArnA derepression facilitates DNA exchange and repair in the presence of DNA damage. The fact that more genes including a dozen of those involved in DDR are found to be regulated by SisArnA implies that the FHA/phosphorylation module may serve as an important signal transduction pathway for transcriptional regulation in archaeal DDR.

Title:    Low-Dose Estrogens as Neuroendocrine Modulators in Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA): The Putative Triggering of the Positive Feedback Mechanism(s)

Abstract:
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is a non-organic reversible chronic endocrine disorder characterized by an impaired pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This impaired secretion, triggered by psychosocial and metabolic stressors, leads to an abnormal pituitary production of gonadotropins. As LH and FSH release is defective, the ovarian function is steadily reduced, inducing a systemic hypoestrogenic condition characterized by amenorrhea, vaginal atrophy, mood changes and increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis of FHA is made excluding other possible causes for secondary amenorrhea, and it is based upon the findings of low serum gonadotropins and estradiol (E2) with evidence of precipitating factors (excessive exercise, low weight, stress). Treatments of women with FHA include weight gain through an appropriate diet and physical activity reduction, psychological support, and integrative approach up to estrogen replacement therapy. If no spontaneous ovarian function is restored, assisted reproductive technologies may be used when pregnancy is desired. Because subjects with FHA are hypoestrogenic, the use of low-dose estrogens has been proposed as a putative treatment to positively modulate the spontaneous restart of gonadotropin secretion, counteracting the blockade of the reproductive axis triggered by stress acting through the neuroendocrine pathways at the basis of positive feedback of estrogens. The mechanism through which low-dose estrogens acts is still unknown, but kisspeptin-secreting neurons may be involved.

Title:    The FHA domain
URL:      https://openalex.org/W2034195376
Journal:  FEBS Letters (2001)
Authors:  Daniel Durocher, Stephen P. Jackson
Abstract:
The forkhead‐associated (FHA) domain is a small protein module recently shown to recognize phosphothreonine epitopes on proteins. It is present in a diverse range of proteins in eukaryotic cells, such as kinases, phosphatases, kinesins, transcription factors, RNA‐binding proteins, and metabolic enzymes. It is also found in a number of bacterial proteins. This suggests that FHA domain‐mediated phospho‐dependent assembly of protein complexes is an ancient and widespread regulatory mechanism.

Title:    Fha Interaction with Phosphothreonine of TssL Activates Type VI Secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003991

Abstract:

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread protein secretion system found in many Gram-negative bacteria. T6SSs are highly regulated by various regulatory systems at multiple levels, including post-translational regulation via threonine (Thr) phosphorylation. The Ser/Thr protein kinase PpkA is responsible for this Thr phosphorylation regulation, and the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing Fha-family protein is the sole T6SS phosphorylation substrate identified to date. Here we discovered that TssL, the T6SS inner-membrane core component, is phosphorylated and the phosphorylated TssL (p-TssL) activates type VI subassembly and secretion in a plant pathogenic bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that TssL is phosphorylated at Thr 14 in a PpkA-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that the PpkA kinase activity is responsible for the Thr 14 phosphorylation, which is critical for the secretion of the T6SS hallmark protein Hcp and the putative toxin effector Atu4347. TssL phosphorylation is not required for the formation of the TssM-TssL inner-membrane complex but is critical for TssM conformational change and binding to Hcp and Atu4347. Importantly, Fha specifically interacts with phosphothreonine of TssL via its pThr-binding motif in vivo and in vitro and this interaction is crucial for TssL interaction with Hcp and Atu4347 and activation of type VI secretion. In contrast, pThr-binding ability of Fha is dispensable for TssM structural transition. In conclusion, we discover a novel Thr phosphorylation event, in which PpkA phosphorylates TssL to activate type VI secretion via its direct binding to Fha in A. tumefaciens. A model depicting an ordered TssL phosphorylation-induced T6SS assembly pathway is proposed.
Author Summary: The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) resembles a contractile phage tail structure and functions to deliver effectors to eukaryotic or prokaryotic target cells for the survival of many pathogenic bacteria. T6SS is highly regulated by various regulatory systems at multiple levels in response to environmental cues. Post-translational regulation via threonine (Thr) phosphorylation is an emerging theme in regulating prokaryotic signaling, including T6SS; the knowledge is mainly contributed by studies of Hcp secretion island 1-encoded T6SS (H1-T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we discover a new phosphorylated target, a T6SS core-component TssL, and demonstrate that this Thr phosphorylation event post-translationally regulates type VI secretion in a plant pathogenic bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We provide the first demonstration that the specific binding of Fha, a forkhead-associated domain-containing protein, to the phosphorylated target is required to stimulate type VI secretion. Genetic and biochemical data strongly suggest an ordered TssL-phosphorylation–dependent assembly and secretion pathway.

Title:    FHA-Mediated Cell-Substrate and Cell-Cell Adhesions Are Critical for Bordetella pertussis Biofilm Formation on Abiotic Surfaces and in the Mouse Nose and the Trachea
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028811
Journal:  PLoS ONE (2011)
Authors:  
Abstract:

        Bordetella spp. form biofilms in the mouse nasopharynx, thereby providing a potential mechanism for establishing chronic infections in humans and animals. Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is a major virulence factor of B. pertussis, the causative agent of the highly transmissible and infectious disease, pertussis. In this study, we dissected the role of FHA in the distinct biofilm developmental stages of B. pertussis on abiotic substrates and in the respiratory tract by employing a murine model of respiratory biofilms. Our results show that the lack of FHA reduced attachment and decreased accumulation of biofilm biomass on artificial surfaces. FHA contributes to biofilm development by promoting the formation of microcolonies. Absence of FHA from B. pertussis or antibody-mediated blockade of surface-associated FHA impaired the attachment of bacteria to the biofilm community. Exogenous addition of FHA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on bacterial association with the biofilms. Furthermore, we show that FHA is important for the structural integrity of biofilms formed on the mouse nose and trachea. Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that FHA promotes the formation and maintenance of biofilms by mediating cell-substrate and inter-bacterial adhesions. These discoveries highlight FHA as a key factor in establishing structured biofilm communities in the respiratory tract.

Title:    Effect of FHA and Prn on Bordetella pertussis colonization of mice is dependent on vaccine type and anatomical site
URL:      https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237394
Journal:  PLOS ONE (2020)
Authors:  
Abstract:

Bordetella pertussis vaccine escape mutants that lack expression of the pertussis antigen pertactin (Prn) have emerged in vaccinated populations in the last 10–20 years. Additionally, clinical isolates lacking another acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine component, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), have been found sporadically. Here, we show that both whole-cell pertussis (wP) and aP vaccines induced protection in the lungs of mice, but that the wP vaccine was more effective in nasal clearance. Importantly, bacterial populations isolated from the lungs shifted to an FHA-negative phenotype due to frameshift mutations in the fhaB gene. Loss of FHA expression was strongly selected for in Prn-deficient strains in the lungs following aP but not wP vaccination. The combined loss of Prn and FHA led to complete abrogation of bacterial surface binding by aP-induced serum antibodies. This study demonstrates vaccine- and anatomical site-dependent adaptation of B. pertussis and has major implications for the design of improved pertussis vaccines.

Title:    Diversity-enhancing Generative Network for Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05948v1
Journal:  arXiv (2023)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays a vital role in addressing the FHA problem

Title:    Information-entropic measures in free and confined hydrogen atom
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05172v1
Journal:  arXiv (2018)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
Shannon entropy ($S$), R{é}nyi entropy ($R$), Tsallis entropy ($T$), Fisher information ($I$) and Onicescu energy ($E$) have been explored extensively in both \emph{free} H atom (FHA) and \emph{confined} H atom (CHA). For a given quantum state, accurate results are presented by employing respective \emph{exact} analytical wave functions in $r$ space. The $p$-space wave functions are generated from respective Fourier transforms$-$for FHA these can be expressed analytically in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials, whereas in CHA these are computed numerically. \emph{Exact} mathematical expressions of $R_r^α, R_p^β$, $T_r^α, T_p^β, E_r, E_p$ are derived for \emph{circular} states of a FHA. Pilot calculations are done taking order of entropic moments ($α, β$) as $(\frac{3}{5}, 3)$ in $r$ and $p$ spaces. A detailed, systematic analysis is performed for both FHA and CHA with respect to state indices $n,l$, and with confinement radius ($r_c$) for the latter. In a CHA, at small $r_{c}$, kinetic energy increases, whereas $S_{\rvec}, R^α_{\rvec}$ decrease with growth of $n$, signifying greater localization in high-lying states. At moderate $r_{c}$, there exists an interplay between two mutually opposing factors: (i) radial confinement (localization) and (ii) accumulation of radial nodes with growth of $n$ (delocalization). Most of these results are reported here for the first time, revealing many new interesting features. Comparison with literature results, wherever possible, offers excellent agreement.

Title:    TOHAN: A One-step Approach towards Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation
URL:      http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06326v2
Journal:  arXiv (2021)
Authors:  ...
Abstract:
In few-shot domain adaptation (FDA), classifiers for the target domain are trained with accessible labeled data in the source domain (SD) and few labeled data in the target domain (TD). However, data usually contain private information in the current era, e.g., data distributed on personal phones. Thus, the private information will be leaked if we directly access data in SD to train a target-domain classifier (required by FDA methods). In this paper, to thoroughly prevent the privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging problem setting, where the classifier for the TD has to be trained using few labeled target data and a well-trained SD classifier, named few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA). In FHA, we cannot access data in SD, as a result, the private information in SD will be protected well. To this end, we propose a target orientated hypothesis adaptation network (TOHAN) to solve the FHA problem, where we generate highly-compatible unlabeled data (i.e., an intermediate domain) to help train a target-domain classifier. TOHAN maintains two deep networks simultaneously, where one focuses on learning an intermediate domain and the other takes care of the intermediate-to-target distributional adaptation and the target-risk minimization. Experimental results show that TOHAN outperforms competitive baselines significantly.
